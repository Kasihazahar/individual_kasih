<p>HI! Who is Kasih? Who is me?</p>
	<p>As some of you guys may know my name is Nur Kasih Binti Azahar. I am a student and
	currently, I studied at UiTM Campus Rembau but during this movement control
	orders (MCO/PKP) we just learn and communicate online seems we must
	stay at home to stop the spread of COVID-19. For your information, I have 4 siblings
	and I am the youngest one. I grew up at Kuala Lumpur for 22 years. I have a few
	close friends at my place and UiTM. I do not make a friend because
	sometimes they find me weird and I do not make one :). I guess I am an
	introvert person because some study or article about this personality said I
	have a unique set of traits that make I who I am. The personality that I identify
	and organizes my characteristics and behaviors in such a way as to help me
	better understand myself. 
	</p>
	<br>
	
	<p>Other than that, I prefer to spend my time with myself rather than spend with others and my
	energy is easily drained by social interactions and I prefer writing over
	talking. For example, I do love text over phone call. Next, I like to take some
	pictures when I am going out for a walk or going to treat myself. The picture
	take I take are mostly what can I see and is in front of me or my surroundings but I just randomly taking
	picture if I see there is a story about it and I always do that whenever I go
	and capture it with my smartphone. For example, skies, clouds, or random
	building that seems classic and vintage. You guys can click the button gallery or
	check my Instagram out but it just a random picture that I frame them to my
	social media like a diary with picture version. 
	</p>

	<p>Furthermore, my hobby or the other things you guys can know about me is what kind of music
	I choose to listen every time. However, I do not have a specific genre to listen, if the song was nice and vibe with me and I just going to listen
	to it but hmm okay at least I can pick one or two genres that I always listened which are rap and hardcore. People who knew me know that but if I was
	going to answer to people I just met or introduce my self about what kind of
	music I listening to, I will choose pop music. My next hobby is going to the
	cinema and spend my money on movies that I like such as horror, thrillers, and
	psycho-thriller and on foods that I love. I prefer going out alone without any company. 
	</p>

	<p>Finally, tell me who does not have a place they want to go? Everyone wants to travel but
	due to insecurities, worries, no money, and many more, that person just stuck in
	one place or their country, and yes you are right, that is me, me is the person
	who stuck at the same place for years. I choose to go mountain or countryside
	it is like how people can nowadays not using technologies such as the telephone and
	the Internet. I like to go to people places is because I want to challenge myself. I
	want to push myself in things I love to do to get me to get out from my comfort
	zone and maybe I will feel pride when I finish my trip successfully or I overcome
	my fear that I told myself the places I never been will be the dangerous place,
	so I must give a shot and that how I capable to build my confidence in communicating
	with strangers that do not know about me. Next, maybe I can be more appreciating
	my life in what I have been through? Who knows I can open my eyes to what special
	my home is about, at the same time explore other places to learn their culture.
